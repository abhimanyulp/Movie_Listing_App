# Movie Listing App

This is a basic movie listing app developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app allows users to view, add, and delete movie details. It uses MongoDB as the database for storing movie information.

## Backend (Node.js)

### Setup
- Set up a basic Node.js backend with Express.js to manage movie data.
- Use the package manager of your choice to install the required dependencies. You can use `npm`:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Database
- Choose either MongoDB or SQL as the database for storing movie details.
- Design a straightforward database schema for movies, focusing on a single collection/table.
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for movies.

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add a new movie to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display a list of movies.
- **Delete**: Remove a movie from the database.

## Frontend (React)

### Setup
- Develop a minimal React frontend with a simple movie listing view.
- Integrate with the Node.js backend to fetch and display movie data.

### Installation
- Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Usage
- Run the React app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
